# JOKIFY

A small AddOn to WoW Classic that allows for some additional jokes when running the macros below:

```
/jokify
/joke
```

The full functionality is added when belonging to the guild 'Stockholm Syndrome' that adds some internal jokes and easter eggs when playing in a party. 

## Installing

Install by downloading the zip-file for this repo, then unzip and move the entire folder into: 
WorldOfWarcraft->_classic_->Interface->AddOns

## Statistics about guild

Working on additional guild-information integration. Currently, only a pop-up prompt is displayed when running the macro:

```
/stats
```
