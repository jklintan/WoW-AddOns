# WoW AddOns

Some small AddOns that I've created for WoW classic, mostly based on internal jokes during dungeons and for testing coding in Lua. 

## Jokify

A small AddOn to WoW Classic that allows for some additional jokes when running the macros below:

```
/jokify
/joke
```

The full functionality is added when belonging to the guild 'Stockholm Syndrome' that adds some internal jokes and easter eggs when playing in a party. 

## Guilder

For additional guild functionality about statistics and a level up message that prints to the guild chat when the player levels up. The following macros are available. 
```
/stats
/lvlmsg
/setlvlmsg
```
/stats displays statistics about amount of online guild members. /lvlmsg displays the current set level up message and by typing /setlvlmsg NEWLVLMESSAGE you set your level up message to NEWLVLMESSAGE, this is saved between sessions. 

## Installing

Install by downloading the zip-file for this repo, then unzip and move the entire folders into:
